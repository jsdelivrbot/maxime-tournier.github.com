# SVD

Any square matrix $$A$$ can be decomposed as:

$$A = USV^T$$

where $$U, V \in O(n)$$ are orthogonal matrices and $$S$$ is diagonal and
positive. It is unique up to a permutation of the diagonal values of $$S$$,
called the *singular values*.

If $$A$$ is not square, the SVD still exists but the $$S$$ matrix is no longer
square.
